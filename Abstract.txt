This is an HID example that demonstrates Human Interface Device (HID)
on USB Device.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/USB/html/dev_hid_tutorial.html

Board:                  ST 'STM32F746G-Discovery'
Microcontroller:        ST 'STM32F746NGH6'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =  25 MHz
                        CPUCLK     = 216 MHz
                        USB FS CLK =  48 MHz
                        USB HS CLK =  60 MHz (from external ULPI PHY)
USB Full-speed:         USB_FS (connector CN13)
USB High-speed:         USB_HS (connector CN12)
User Interface:         input:  User button
                        output: LD1  LED

The example demonstrates a Human Interface Device. The board LED and
push button can be accessed from the PC through a custom
HID Client Program (<Keil-root>\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release\HIDClient.exe).

The program is available in different targets:

 - Debug:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Enabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Source
   - USB:CORE:                  Debug

 - Release:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 3
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Disabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Library
   - USB:CORE:                  Release

JUMPER SETTINGS:
  - JP1 in position "5V link"

Note:
  - Define C Preprocessor symbol USBD_FS_VBUS_DETECT=0 as this board does not
    support VBUS detect on USB_FS port (PA9 not connected)
